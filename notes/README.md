# 📂 Notes Folder Overview

> “Learning isn’t always linear. Sometimes the best ideas come from asking the weirdest questions.” 

## 🌟 Purpose

This `notes` folder serves as a dynamic collection of spontaneous questions, clarifications, and “aha!” moments that arose during my learning journey in programming. Unlike the `material/` directory which is organized by structured topics, this folder captures my curiosity in its raw and chaotic beauty.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

You'll find:

- ❓ **Question-based notes** – Random questions I asked while studying Flutter
- ✍️ **Quick clarifications** – Short explanations based on my confusion at the moment
- ⚡ **Side explorations** – Things that popped into my head and needed answers *right then and there*
- 🔄 **Cross-language comparisons** – Comparing how Java, Python, and Dart handle the same concept

These files are named by sequence or context, not topic, so don't expect a linear learning path. This folder is **not** for teaching others, but a personal space to track how my thinking evolves. 🤓

## 📚 Example Topics You Might See

- Why does Dart use `var` when declaring objects?
- How is `super()` in Dart different from Java?
- Is constructor only for assigning variables?

## 🔥 Why This Folder Matters

Sometimes, structured learning (like textbooks) can’t capture the chaotic but real thought process of someone who’s still figuring things out. So this folder is more like a safe space to note down thoughts, questions, and confusion as they happen — a kind of personal learning journal that’s honest and unfiltered.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Folder

- Skim through when I feel stuck — I might’ve asked the same question before!
- Reuse insights when organizing structured `.md` materials later
- Turn some of these into blog posts or study case reflections
- Track personal growth: “I used to ask this? Now I can explain it!”
